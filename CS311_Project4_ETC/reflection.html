            For this assignment I chose to use Foundation as my framework of choice. Part of my decision lied within the 
            ability to see the code directly underneath an example, allowing for easy copy-and-pasting while being able to 
            see the code compared to the example. I feel like this helped me match up what the HTML and CSS codes were doing 
            in the example. I first ran into some issues in my home page. I wanted the navigation to be its own separate 
            div so I needed to resize the grid. I also only needed 2 columns in the middle (1 for a picture, 1 for the 
            introduction). So resizing the grid proved to be a bit of a challenge. After adjusting the size of the grid, the 
            next problem came with resizing the divs to cover a certain amount of the screen. The header, nav, and footer 
            were easy. But the row with the picture and intro was challenging. The intro div was not wanting to stretch to the 
            last column. I was eventually able to figure out how to correct this problem. In the columns portion of the grid, 
            I was able to simply delete one of the fractions, and change the second fraction to be larger than the first to 
            allow for the paragraph to be larger than the picture.</p>

            Outside of resizing columns and rows appropriately, this assignment went fairly smoothly. Using the given grid from 
            Foundation helped a lot once I was able to dissect the code and understand it. I've had some exposure to HTML and CSS 
            through both this course and some high school classes. A lot of this work refreshed my memory and a lot introduced me
            to new topics and ideas. I had never used a grid before and I found it super useful! It was easy to manipulate the
            sizes of containers and place things where I wanted to. I had a little extra fun with it by adding the custom cursor,
            and also adding links to music through the composers' images.
